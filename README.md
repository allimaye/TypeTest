# TypeTest (In progress)

Type testing application that allows users to measure their typing speed. The AngularJS based MVC web app requires the user to write a random paragraph consisting of above-average punctuation and grammar. Based on how fast the user is able to type in that paragraph, typing speed, and accuracy are measured. Other notable features are voice dictation using ResponsiveVoiceJS and Angular Material UI effects to indicate the user has spelt a word wrong.
